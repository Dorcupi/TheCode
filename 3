You measure my life in hours and I serve you by expiring. I’m quick when I’m thin and slow when I’m fat. The wind is my enemy.

I have cities, but no houses. I have mountains, but no trees. I have water, but no fish. What am I?

What is seen in the middle of March and April that can’t be seen at the beginning or end of either month?
